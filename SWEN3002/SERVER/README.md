You can make your server public by sumbitting in on the issues page using the syntax:

{
    "name": "Server Name",
    "ip": "ip address here",
    "port": "port number here"
}

With the issue title: "Public Server Submission"

Once your server has been submitted it will be filtered out by CipherChat clients.
